# Detection of genomic alterations using error-corrected cfDNA sequencing

Several recent studies have demonstrated the ability of cfDNA sequencing to provide early prognostication, better molecular profiling and monitoring of disease dynamics with many applications in genomic-driven oncology. 

We provide a bioinformatics pipeline that offers ctDNA data preprocessing using UMIs, ultra-sensitive detection of SNVs using duplexCaller (available at https://github.com/dkleftogi/duplexFiltering) and evaluation of fragmentation profiles of cfDNA.
