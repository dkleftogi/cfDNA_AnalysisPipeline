# Detection of genomic alterations using cfDNA sequencing

Analysis of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) data has opened new opportunities for characterizing tumor mutational landscapes with many applications in genomic-driven oncology. We developed a customized targeted cfDNA sequencing approach for breast cancer (BC) using unique molecular identifiers for error correction (UMIs). 

Here we provide the bioinformatics pipeline that offers ctDNA data preprocessing using UMIs, ultra-sensitive detection of SNVs using duplexCaller and evaluation of fragmentation profiles of cfDNA.

duplexCaller is a freely available software developed at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and it is available at https://github.com/dkleftogi/duplexFiltering

Here we provide a newer version of duplexCaller that is part of a more complete bioinformatics workflow for the analysis of cfDNA data.
